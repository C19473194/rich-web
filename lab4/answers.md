Explain using code examples what is meant by props and state in 
React JS? 
 
In React, both props and state are fundamental concepts used to manage data and control the 
behavior of components. 
Props:
Props, short for properties, are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. 
They are immutable, meaning that their value cannot be changed by the child component.
Example: Parent Component Passing Props to Child Component
// ParentComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const dataFromParent = 'Hello from Parent!';

  return <ChildComponent message={dataFromParent} />;
};

// ChildComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';

const ChildComponent = (props) => {
  return <div>{props.message}</div>;
};

export default ChildComponent;
In this example, the ParentComponent passes a message as a prop to ChildComponent. The 
child component receives this prop and renders it.
State:
State is used to manage the internal state of a component. Unlike props, the state can be 
changed by the component itself, typically triggered by user interactions or asynchronous events.
Example: Component with State
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const CounterComponent = () => {
  // Define state variable and its setter function
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    // Update the state using the setter function
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CounterComponent;

Combined Example: Using Props and State Together
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [childData, setChildData] = useState('Initial Data');

  const updateChildData = () => {
    setChildData('Updated Data');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent message={childData} />
      <button onClick={updateChildData}>Update Child Data</button>
    </div>
  );
};

const ChildComponent = (props) => {
  return <div>{props.message}</div>;
};

export default ParentComponent;

In this example, CounterComponent has an internal state variable count initialized to 0. The 
component renders the current count and a button. When the button is clicked, the 
incrementCount function is called, updating the state using setCount. React will then re-render 
the component with the updated state. 
 
In this combined example, the ParentComponent maintains the state (childData) and passes it 
as a prop to ChildComponent. When the button is clicked, the state is updated, triggering a re-
render of ParentComponent and passing the updated data to ChildComponent. 

In functional programming, what does the term functor mean? Can you give 
an example in JavaScript? 
In functional programming, a functor is an object or data structure that implements a map 
function, allowing you to transform the values inside it while preserving the structure. Functors 
provide a way to apply a function to each element within a context, such as an array, without 
changing the structure of that context.
In JavaScript, arrays are a common example of functors because they have a map function that 
allows you to apply a function to each element in the array.
Here's a simple example of a functor in JavaScript using an object:
// Functor example
const myFunctor = {
    value: 42,
    map: function (func) {
      return { value: func(this.value) };
    },
  };
  
  // Function to double a value
  const double = (x) => x * 2;
  
  // Using the functor to apply the function
  const resultFunctor = myFunctor.map(double);
  
  console.log(resultFunctor.value); // Output: 84
In this example, myFunctor is a functor because it has a map function that takes another 
function (double) and applies it to the value inside the functor while preserving the structure. The 
map function returns a new functor with the transformed value.
It's important to note that functors, in the context of functional programming, adhere to certain 
laws, such as identity and composition, which ensure consistent behavior and maintain the 
properties of the functor when operations are performed.

We have looked at three kinds of asynchronous programming mechanisms, namely callbacks, 
promises and streams. Mention one advantage and one disadvantage of each type. 
Callbacks:
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after the 
completion of a particular operation or task.
Example: 

function fetchData(callback) {
    // Simulating asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = "Async data";
      callback(data);
    }, 1000);
  }
  
  fetchData((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  });

Advantage:
*	Simplicity: Callbacks are simple and easy to understand. They are a fundamental part of 
JavaScript and have been used for handling asynchronous operations for a long time.
Disadvantage:
*	Callback Hell (Pyramid of Doom): When dealing with multiple nested callbacks, the 
code structure can become hard to read and maintain, leading to a situation known as 
"callback hell" or the "pyramid of doom."
Promises: Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an 
asynchronous operation. They provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle 
asynchronous code compared to callbacks.
Advantage:
*	Chaining and Composition: Promises support chaining, which allows for cleaner and 
more readable code. This facilitates composing asynchronous operations in a way that 
resembles synchronous code, making it easier to reason about.
Disadvantage:
*	Non-Cancellation: Promises lack built-in cancellation support. Once a promise is 
initiated, it cannot be easily cancelled, which can be a limitation in some scenarios.
Streams: Streams are a way of handling sequences of data over time. They allow  to consume or 
produce data asynchronously in a more efficient and scalable manner.
Advantage:
*	Backpressure: Streams support backpressure, meaning that a slower consumer can 
signal a faster producer to slow down. This helps in scenarios where the data production 
rate is higher than the consumption rate, preventing resource exhaustion.
Disadvantage:
*	Learning Curve: Working with streams can have a steeper learning curve compared to 
callbacks and promises. Understanding concepts like backpressure and the various 
stream types may require more effort.
It's worth noting that the choice of asynchronous mechanism depends on the specific use case 
and the requirements of the application. Promises and, more recently, async/await syntax have 
become more prevalent in modern JavaScript development due to their readability and ease of 
use. Streams are particularly powerful when dealing with large sets of data or handling real-time 
data flows.

With the aid of a diagram and example code, describe the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Box 
Model and show how it can be used to space DOM elements
 
The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes the structure of an HTML element 
as a rectangular box. This box includes content, padding, border, and margin. Each of these 
components contributes to the overall size and spacing of the element. Here's a breakdown of 
the CSS Box Model components:
1.	Content: The actual content of the element, such as text or images.
2.	Padding: The space between the content and the element's border.
3.	Border: A border surrounding the padding (optional).
4.	Margin: The space between the border and adjacent elements (optional).
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <style>
    /* Apply styles to the box */
    .box {
      width: 200px;
      height: 100px;
      padding: 20px;
      border: 2px solid #333;
      margin: 20px;
    }
  </style>
  <title>CSS Box Model Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- HTML content with the box -->
  <div class="box">
    This is the content of the box.
  </div>
</body>
</html>
In this example:
*	The .box class sets the width and height of the content box and adds padding, a border, 
and margin.
*	The width and height define the size of the content box.
*	padding adds space inside the content box.
*	border creates a border around the padding.
*	margin adds space outside the border.
The final appearance of the box on the webpage will reflect the combined effect of 
content, padding, border, and margin as defined by the Box Model. Adjusting these 
properties allows for precise control over the spacing and layout of HTML elements.


Detail how the browser loads and bootstraps a rich web application from an initial URL 
 
The process of loading and bootstrapping a rich web application involves several steps, from the 
initial URL input to the rendering of the application in the browser. Here's an overview of the 
typical process:
1.	URL Parsing:
*	When a user enters a URL into the browser's address bar or clicks on a link, the 
browser initiates a process to parse the URL.
*	The URL consists of several components, including the protocol (e.g., "http" or 
"https"), the domain, the path, and potentially query parameters and fragments.
2.	DNS Resolution:
*	The browser performs Domain Name System (DNS) resolution to translate the 
domain name in the URL into an IP address.
*	The resolved IP address is used to establish a connection with the server hosting 
the web application.
3.	HTTP Request:
*	The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying the requested 
resource based on the URL.
*	The server processes the request and returns an HTTP response, typically 
containing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.
4.	HTML Parsing and Rendering:
*	The browser starts parsing the received HTML document. As it parses the HTML, 
it builds the Document Object Model (DOM), a representation of the document's 
structure.
*	The browser begins rendering the initial content as it encounters it in the HTML.
5.	CSS and JavaScript Loading:
*	While parsing the HTML, the browser encounters external stylesheets (CSS) and 
JavaScript files referenced in the document.
*	External CSS files are fetched, and the browser applies styles to the rendered 
content.
*	External JavaScript files are fetched, and their execution is deferred until the 
HTML parsing is complete.
6.	DOM and CSSOM Construction:
*	The browser continues building the DOM and constructs the CSS Object Model 
(CSSOM) by parsing and processing the stylesheets.
*	The DOM and CSSOM are combined to create the Render Tree, which represents 
the visual elements to be displayed.
7.	Render Tree Layout and Painting:
*	The browser performs layout, determining the positioning and size of each 
element in the Render Tree.
*	After layout, the browser paints the elements on the screen, forming the initial 
visual representation of the web page.
8.	JavaScript Execution:
*	Deferred JavaScript is executed, potentially modifying the DOM or interacting with 
the rendered content.
*	JavaScript may dynamically fetch additional resources, update the DOM, and 
trigger further rendering.
9.	User Interaction:
*	The user can interact with the rendered web application. Events triggered by user 
actions (e.g., clicks or keystrokes) may lead to further JavaScript execution and 
DOM updates.
This process, often referred to as the Critical Rendering Path, results in the complete loading and 
rendering of a rich web application. Techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and 
asynchronous loading are often employed to optimize the loading performance of web 
applications, especially those with complex and large codebases.
